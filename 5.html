<p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>


<p>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing the web grow and be even more useful...</p>

<p><em>Put up some data</em><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See more details , etiquette.</p>

<p><em>Suggest someone else does</em><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?</p>

<p><em>Manage a subject area</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?</p>

<p><em>Write some software</em><br/>
